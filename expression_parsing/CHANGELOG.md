# Changelog: compareexpressions-expression-parsing

## 0.3.0 (unreleased)

Further tidy-up after the 0.2.0 extraction: previewing a response and mapping failures to learner-facing feedback text are app-layer concerns, so they move out of this package.

### Breaking

- `preview_function`, `parse_symbolic`, `Preview`, `Result`, `ExpressionSyntaxError`, `FeedbackTag` and `FeedbackTagName` have moved out of this package entirely, to compareExpressions: rendering a response as LaTeX/SymPy, and mapping a tag to feedback text, are app-layer display concerns, not expression parsing.
- `preprocess_expression`, `convert_bracket_notation` and `convert_absolute_notation` now return a plain `str` (raising instead of returning `Preprocessed`/a `(str, FeedbackTag | None)` tuple). The `Preprocessed` dataclass is gone. `BracketNotationError` and `AbsoluteValueNotationError` (both `ExpressionParsingError`) are raised on failure; each carries the best-guess rewrite as `.expression`, so a caller can catch it, decide whether to continue with the guess (adding non-fatal feedback) or propagate, exactly as `compareExpressions` already did per-context (learner response vs. answer/criteria).
- `convert_bracket_notation` now computes a best-guess rewrite even on a bracket-kind mismatch (e.g. `[x+y)` guesses `(x+y)`), instead of leaving the expression untouched. This often recovers a wrong-*kind* mismatch outright; a genuinely unbalanced expression still fails downstream.
- Every exception in `errors.py` now carries structured fields instead of only a message: `UnknownConventionError.convention`, `SymbolAssumptionError.text`/`.symbol`/`.assumption`, `LatexParseError.symbol`/`.expression`/`.response`/`.wrapper`, `ExpressionParsingError.expression` (the base, used by generic parse failures). The duplicated "Unknown convention" check (`conventions.py` and `params.py`) is now one `validate_convention` helper.

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

The first release after the extraction refactor. The import path is now `compareexpressions.expression_parsing` (was `expression_parsing`).

### Renamed and restructured

Parameters are typed now. Build an `ExpressionParams` with `ExpressionParams.from_dict(evaluation_params)` (JSON keys such as `complexNumbers` are mapped, unrelated keys ignored). It is immutable, and its `symbols` are normalised on construction: blank codes and aliases are dropped, aliases stripped, and `lambda` moved to `lamda`, which always exists. `SympyParsingConfig` replaces the `parsing_params` dict. `preview_function` still accepts a plain parameter mapping.

| v0.1 | 0.2.0 |
|---|---|
| `expression_parsing` (import) | `compareexpressions.expression_parsing` |
| `default_parameters` (dict) | `ExpressionParams()` defaults |
| `params` dicts passed to `substitute_input_symbols`, `create_expression_set`, `preprocess_expression` | `ExpressionParams` |
| `create_sympy_parsing_params(params, unsplittable_symbols, symbol_assumptions)` → dict | `SympyParsingConfig.from_params(params, unsplittable_symbols, symbol_assumptions)`; variants via `.replace(...)` |
| `parse_expression(expr, parsing_params)` | `parse_expression(expr, config)`. It still doesn't substitute symbol aliases: run `preprocess_expression` first. |
| `preprocess_expression(...)` → `(success, expr, feedback)` | → `Preprocessed(expression, feedback)` with `.success` |
| `convert_bracket_notation` / `convert_absolute_notation` → `(expr, (tag, FeedbackTag))` | → `(expr, FeedbackTag \| None)` |
| `FeedbackTag` namedtuple | frozen dataclass `FeedbackTag(tag, inputs)`; tag names in the `FeedbackTagName` `StrEnum` |
| `parse_symbolic` raised `SyntaxError(FeedbackTag(...))` | raises `ExpressionSyntaxError`; the tag is `.feedback` |
| `preview_function` raised `ValueError` | raises `ExpressionParsingError` (a `ValueError`) |
| `parse_latex(response, symbols, simplify, parameters=None)` | `parse_latex(response, symbols, simplify=False)`; `symbols` maps codes to `SymbolSpec` |
| `sympy_to_latex(expr, symbols_dict, settings)` | `sympy_to_latex(expr, params.symbols, settings)` |
| symbol dicts `{"latex": ..., "aliases": [...]}` / `SymbolDict` / `SymbolData` | `SymbolSpec(latex, aliases)`; `from_dict` accepts the dict form |
| `Params` TypedDict | removed: pass a mapping or `ExpressionParams` |
| `Preview` / `Result` TypedDicts | same names; `feedback` is `NotRequired` (lf_toolkit's `Preview` requires it) |
| `SLR_implicit_multiplication_convention_parser(convention)` | `convention_parser(convention)` (cached per convention) |
| `preprocess_according_to_chosen_convention(expr, params)` | `apply_convention(expr, convention)` |
| `transform_unicode_greek_symbols` / `protect_elementary_functions_substitutions` / `convert_unicode_dashes` | `substitution.greek_symbol_substitutions` / `elementary_function_substitutions` / `unicode_dash_substitutions` |
| `elementary_functions_names` / `special_symbols_names` (lists mutated at import) | `symbol_tables.ELEMENTARY_FUNCTIONS` / `GREEK_SYMBOLS` (tuples of `SymbolAliases`) |
| `is_number_regex` / `is_nonnegative_number_regex` | `numbers.NUMBER_REGEX` / `NONNEGATIVE_NUMBER_REGEX` |
| `patterns` (dict of dicts) | `PATTERNS` (dict of `SyntacticalPattern`) |
| `ModifiedLatexPrinter`, `symbol_latex_re` | private `_LatexPrinter`; `latex.SYMBOL_LATEX_RE` |

Modules: `params`, `symbol_tables`, `preprocessing`, `substitution`, `conventions`, `sympy_parsing`, `latex`, `preview`, `numbers`, `feedback`, `errors` (replacing `expression_utilities`, `preview_utilities`, `symbolic_preview` and `syntactical_comparison`). The `typing_extensions` dependency is dropped.

Behaviour changes from normalising symbols once: every code path now sees the task's `lambda` symbol as `lamda`, printed with the task's LaTeX (direct `parse_expression` + `sympy_to_latex` used to fall back to `\lambda`, and the LaTeX preview output `lambda`), and `lamda` is always an unsplittable symbol.

Also: the implicit-multiplication convention parser is built once per convention instead of on every parse, and `create_expression_set` returns its expressions in first-seen order (it used to be set order, which depends on the hash seed); substitution precedence ties are broken deterministically.

### Security

- **`symbol_assumptions` is no longer evaluated as code.** The parameter string (e.g. `"('a','positive') ('f','function')"`) was passed to `eval()`, and each assumption was pasted into another `eval("Symbol('x', <assumption>=True)")`, so a task author (or anyone who could set evaluation parameters) could run arbitrary Python. Groups are now read with `ast.literal_eval` and must be pairs of strings; assumption names must be identifiers and are passed as `Symbol(name, **{assumption: True})`. Malformed input raises `SymbolAssumptionError` (a `ValueError`). Valid assumptions behave as before, including `constant` and `function`.

### Fixed

- Inputs such as `2E` or `xE` parse (fixed in `slr_parsing`: the implicit-multiplication convention parser scanned a capital `E` as its grammar symbol).
- `parse_expression("a=b=c")` raises `ExpressionParsingError` instead of silently returning `Eq(a, b)` (everything after the second `=` was dropped).
- With `strict_syntax`, arithmetic on `{}` set literals (e.g. `{x+1}*{x-1}`) raises `ExpressionParsingError`. It used to build `Mul(FiniteSet, FiniteSet)`, which SymPy deprecates (the `SymPyDeprecationWarning` noted in `NOTES.md`) and will reject in a future version.
- `create_sympy_parsing_params` fills in missing parameters from the defaults instead of raising `KeyError` (e.g. for `complexNumbers`) when the caller hasn't merged `default_parameters` first.
- `preview_function` works when a symbol is defined without `latex` (e.g. `{"bc": {"aliases": ["bc"]}}`). It raised `KeyError: 'latex'`, so compareExpressions showed the raw response instead of its LaTeX. (Found while adopting the packages in compareExpressions.)
- `create_expression_set` no longer raises `IndexError` when an expression is only `plus_minus` (± with nothing after it).
- A user-defined `lambda` symbol keeps its LaTeX and aliases. `substitute_input_symbols` renames `lambda` to `lamda` inside `params["symbols"]`, and a second call (the preview makes several) replaced the renamed symbol with the default one, so previews showed `\lambda` instead of the task's LaTeX and custom aliases stopped working.
- Symbol aliases are stripped and blank aliases dropped as intended. The `.strip()` result was discarded, and blank aliases were deleted by index while the list shrank, which removed real aliases (e.g. `["", "", "xx"]` lost `"xx"`). The same cleanup for the legacy `input_symbols` format is fixed too; it could raise `IndexError` on an empty entry.
- `preview_function` and `parse_latex` no longer modify the caller's parameters (they merged in defaults, set `rationalise`, and normalised `symbols` in place), and `sympy_to_latex` no longer adds its default settings to the caller's `settings` dict.
- `parse_latex` no longer prints alias parse errors to stdout (an alias that isn't an expression is still used as a plain symbol name), and raises `LatexParseError` (a `ValueError`) with a single message. It used to raise `ValueError("Failed to pass expression during preview: ", str(e))`, whose message was a tuple.
- `sanitise_latex` raises `LatexParseError` for an unclosed `\mathrm{` / `\text{` instead of looping forever (the scan restarted from the beginning). units' LaTeX preview runs it on learner input, so a malformed response would hang the evaluation.
- `parse_latex` splits a top-level `=` itself and returns `Eq(lhs, rhs)`, rejecting more than one `=`. The PyPI release of latex2sympy2 (this package's dependency) reads `x = 2` as an *assignment*: it returns `2` and stores `x` in module-global state. The lambda-feedback fork that compareExpressions uses returns `Eq(x, 2)`, and results now match that on either build. (This package depends on PyPI latex2sympy2 so that it stays publishable.)
