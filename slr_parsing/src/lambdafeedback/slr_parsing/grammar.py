"""Grammar building blocks: token specifications, productions and error handlers.

A grammar is a list of token specifications plus a list of productions.

Token specifications are tuples in one of three shapes:

``(pattern, label)``
    A regular expression; input text matching it becomes a ``label`` token.
    Grammar symbols (``START``, nonterminals, ...) are declared this way too,
    since production strings are scanned with the same specifications.
``(pattern, label, matcher)``
    ``matcher(text) -> (matched, content)`` is tried at each position:
    ``matched`` is the consumed text (or ``None``) and ``content`` the
    token's content.
``(symbol, label, catch_undefined)``
    At most one per grammar: runs of text that no other specification
    matches become ``label`` tokens (without it, such text is a
    :class:`ScanError`).
``(symbol, label, None)``
    A symbol that only appears in productions and is never scanned from
    input.

Productions are ``(head, body, action)`` triples (or :class:`Production`),
where ``head`` and ``body`` are scanned into grammar symbols and ``action``
builds the output tree when the production is reduced. When productions
conflict, the one listed later wins.
