# Changelog: lambdafeedback-slr-parsing

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

The first release after the extraction refactor. The import path is now `lambdafeedback.slr_parsing` (was `slr_parsing`).

### Renamed

| v0.1 | 0.2.0 |
|---|---|
| `slr_parsing` (import) | `lambdafeedback.slr_parsing` |
| `SLR_Parser` | `SLRParser` |
| `SLR_expression_parser(..., costum_tokens=, costum_productions=)` | `build_expression_parser(..., custom_tokens=, custom_productions=)` |
| `tag` | `add_tag` |
| `tag_removal` | `remove_tag` |
| `tag_replace` | `replace_tag` |
| `tag_transfer` | `inherit_tags` |
| `tag_rule_union` / `tag_rule_intersection` | `union_rule` / `intersection_rule` |

### Changed

- **Errors:** bare `Exception`s are replaced by `GrammarError` (invalid grammar), `ScanError` (text no token matches) and `ParseError` (input doesn't match the grammar). All derive from `SLRError` and `ValueError`. `ParseError`'s message is a one-line summary ("Unexpected end of input.", "Unexpected OP '+' at position 3."); the full parser-state dump that used to be the message is available from `ParseError.details()`, with the parts as attributes. An invalid `ExprNode` child raises `TypeError`.
- **Logging instead of printing:** `parse()` no longer takes `verbose`; set the `lambdafeedback.slr_parsing.parser` logger to DEBUG to trace shifts and reductions. Unreachable grammar states and reductions are logged as a WARNING instead of printed, and the start state is no longer falsely reported.
- `build_expression_parser` drops the unused `group_node` parameter; sequence defaults are tuples instead of shared mutable lists.
- `SLRParser` keeps its construction internals private. The public surface is `scan`, `parse`, `parsing_action`, `parsing_table`, `states` (now a list of kernel item tuples, was a dict of kernel → closure), `productions`, `token_list`, `start_token`/`end_token`/`null_token`, `error_handler`, `tag_handler` and the debug helpers `state_string` and `parsing_table_to_string`. `state_string_list` is removed.
- Error handlers are normalised to `ErrorHandler(condition, action)` named tuples; plain 2-tuples are still accepted.
- `replace_tag(node, t, t)` keeps the tag (it used to remove it).
- Modules: `tokens`, `actions`, `tags`, `grammar` (with the grammar format documented), `errors`, `parser`, `builder`. Fully type-annotated (`py.typed`).

### Fixed

- `ExprNode` tag sets are no longer shared. Before, every node built without a tag handler shared the mutable default `tags=set()`, `copy()` shared the original's set, and `tag_transfer` returned a single child's own set as its parent's tags. Tagging one node could tag unrelated nodes.
- `str(ExprNode)` shows the node's tags whenever it has any; it used to hide them unless there were two or more. Empty tags print as `tags: {}` (was `tags:  {}`).
- A custom `expression_node` passed to the expression-parser builder no longer becomes a literal token. The implicit-multiplication convention parser in `expression_parsing` uses `"E"` as its node symbol, so every capital `E` in an input was scanned as a grammar symbol and inputs such as `2E` or `xE` failed to parse.
- Multi-character infix operators (such as `**`) work in the expression-parser builder. Its productions were built from only the first character of each operator symbol.
- `SLR_Parser` no longer sorts the caller's `token_list` in place.
- `scan()` raises `ValueError` for an unknown `mode` (it used to crash with `UnboundLocalError`), and matches the mode exactly rather than by substring.
- `group(0)` and `operate(0)` raise `ValueError`. `operate(0)` was accepted and would have consumed the entire output stack.
- Each production runs its own reduction action. Actions used to be looked up by production *body*, so two productions with the same body but different heads (such as `A -> x` and `B -> x`) both ran whichever action was defined last. None of the grammars in these packages had such a pair.
- Traversing a `GROUP` node calls the action once, not twice. Actions with side effects ran twice per group: units recorded every reverted unit group as two identical `REVERTED_UNIT` messages.
- `new_root_on_error` works: parsing resumes at the offending token and the extra roots are appended to the output. Before, the offending token was dropped and `parse()` crashed on the remaining tokens.

### Removed

- `package` reduction action: unused, and it stored the `repr` of its children list as the node content. Use `join` (merge into one node) or a custom action.
- `discard_output_until_on_error`: unused, and it could not work. It popped parser output without unwinding the state stack, so every use ended in `IndexError`.
